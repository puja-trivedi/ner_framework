  description: >
    From the given {literature} extract named entities from neuroscience statements. 
    A named entity is anything that can be referred to with a proper name. 
    Some common named entities in neuroscience articles are animal species (e.g., mouse, drosophila, zebrafish), anatomical regions (e.g., neocortex, mushroom body, cerebellum), experimental conditions (e.g., control, tetrodotoxin treatment, Scn1a knockout), and cell types (e.g., pyramidal neuron, direction-sensitive mechanoreceptor, oligodendrocyte)
  expected_output: >
    Provide the output in the following format.
