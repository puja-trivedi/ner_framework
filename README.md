# StructSense

Welcome to `structsense`!

`structsense` is a powerful multi-agent system designed to extract structured information from unstructured data. By orchestrating intelligent agents, it helps you make sense of complex information â€” hence the name *structsense*.

Whether you're working with scientific texts, documents, or messy data, `structsense` enables you to transform it into meaningful, structured insights.

**Caution:**: this package is still under development and may change rapidly over the next few weeks.
