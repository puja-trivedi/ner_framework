At the beginning of each trial, two shapes appeared on a gray background (RGB: 128128128) on a standard computer monitor placed in front of the subject. A yellow circle (15-pixels in diameter) was an avatar for the research participant. Its position was determined by the joystick and was limited by the screen boundaries. A square shape (30 pixels in length) represented the prey. The movement of the prey was determined by a simple artificial intelligence algorithm (see below). Each trial ended with either the successful capture of the prey or after 20 sec, whichever came first. Successful capture was defined as any spatial overlap between the avatar circle and the prey square.', 'Capture resulted in scored points; the number of points corresponded to prey color as follows: 1 point for orange; 3 points for green; 5 points for cyan.', 'The path of the prey was generated interactively using A-star pathfinding methods, which are commonly used in video gaming (Hart  Nils, 1968). For every frame (16.67 ms), we computed the cost of 15 possible future positions the prey could move to in the next time-step. These 15 positions were equally spaced on the circumference of a circle centered on the current position of the prey, with a radius equal to the maximum distance the prey could travel within one time-step. The cost in turn was based on the following two factors: the position in the field and the position of the avatar of the subject. The field that the prey moved in had a built-in bias for cost, which made the prey more likely to move toward the center. The cost due to distance from the avatar of the subject was transformed using a sigmoidal function: the cost became zero beyond a certain distance so that the prey did not move, and it became greater as distance from the avatar of the subject decreased. Eventually, the costs from these 15 positions were calculated and the position with the lowest cost was selected for the next movement. If the next movement was beyond the screen range (1,800  1,000 resolution), then the position with the second lowest cost was selected, and so on.', 'The maximum speed of the participant was 23 pixels per frame (and each frame was 16.67 ms). The maximum and minimum speeds of the prey remained the same across subjects. In trials with predators, a predator (triangle shape) appeared on 50 of trials. Capture by the predator led to points loss. Predators came in five different types (indicated by color) indicating different levels of points loss, ranging from 1 to 5 points.', 'The algorithm of the predator is to minimize the distance between itself and player.', 'Unlike the prey, the predator algorithm is governed by this single rule. The design of the task reflects primarily the desire to have a rich and variegated virtual world with opportunities for choices at multiple levels that is neither trivially simple nor overly complex.']\"}, {'heading': 'Task presentation', 'content': \"['Patients played at least 100 trials (average 119 trials) of the prey-pursuit task using a joystick (Figure 1A,B). The joystick was a commercially available joystick with a built-in potentiometer (Logitech Extreme Pro 3D). The joystick position was read out by a custom-coded program in Matlab running on the stimulus-control computer. The joystick was controlled by an algorithm that detected the positional change of the joystick and limited the maximum pixel movement to within 23 pixels in 16.67 ms. Task events were synchronized to the neural recording system via comments, sent through analog port, from the computer playing the task to the Neural Signal Processor (NSP) at 30 kHz.']\"}, {'heading': 'Linear-nonlinear model (LN-GLM).', 'content': \"['To test the selectivity of neurons for various experimental variables, we constructed GLMs with navigational variables (Hardcastle et al., 2017;Pillow et al., 2008). The GLMs estimated the spike rate of one neuron during time bin t as an exponential function of the weighted sum of the relevant value of each variable at time t, for which the weights are determined by a set of coefficients (wi). The estimated firing rates from the GLMs can be expressed as follows:', 'Where r denotes a vector of firing rates for one neuron over T time points across the session, and i indexes the variables of interest, for example, the position of the avatar on the screen. The vector of firing rates over T time points provide the benefit for modeling the neural activity without the need of specifically timelocking to a behavioral event. Xi is a matrix in which each column represents a set of state variables of the subject obtained from binning the continuous variable so that all the columns for a particular row are 0, except for one column. In this case, state variables were obtained binning the position of self and prey over a 6x6 grid (36 bins). As a result, each neuron was assigned a design matrix with rows corresponding to the number of samples and columns corresponding to the number of bins.', 'Unlike conventional tuning curve analysis, GLM analysis does not assume the parametric shape of the tuning curve a priori. Instead, the weights, which define the shape of tuning for each neuron, were optimized by maximizing the Poisson loglikelihood of the observed spike train given the model-expected spike number, with additional regularization for the smoothness of parameters in a continuous variable, and a lasso regularization for parameters in a discrete variable. Position parameters were separately smoothed across rows and columns. The regularization hyperparameter was chosen by maximizing the cross-validation log-likelihood based on several randomly selected neurons. The unconstrained optimization with gradient and Hessian was performed (Matlab fminunc function). The model performance of each neuron was quantified by the log-likelihood of held out data under the model (Figure 2C). This cross-validation procedure was repeated ten times (tenfold cross-validation), and overfitting was penalized. Through multiple levels of penalties, we compared the performance of models with varying complexity.']\"}, {'heading': 'Forward model selection', 'content': \"['Model selection was based on the cross-validated log-likelihood value for each model. We first fit n models with a single variable, where n is the total number of variables. The best single model was determined by the largest increase in spikenormalized log-likelihood from the null model (that is, the model with a single parameter representing the mean firing rate). Then, additional variables (n -1 in total) were added to the best single variable model. The best two variable model was preferred over the single variable model only if it significantly improved the cross-validation log-likelihood value (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, α  0.05). Likewise, the procedure was continued for the three-variable model and beyond if adding more variables significantly improved the model performance, and the best, simplest model was selected. The cell was categorized as not tuned to any of the variables considered if the log-likelihood increase was not significantly higher than baseline, which was the mean firing rate of fitted neurons across the session.']\"}, {'heading': 'Spatial similarity index (SPAEF)', 'content': \"['To compare the similarity between two spatial representations, we used the spatial efficiency measure (SPAEF) that prior literature suggests to be more robust than the 2D spatial correlation (Koch et al, 2018). It quantifies the similarity between two maps as follows:', 'where A is the Pearson correlation between two maps, B is the ratio between the coefficients of variation for each map and C is the activity similarity measured by histogram profiles. Values near -1 indicate anticorrelated maps (one tends to be high when the other is low), 0 indicates uncorrelated maps and 1 indicates perfect matching between the two. By definition, SPAEF is not strictly constrained between -1 and 1.', 'However, values outside this range tend to be rare, and in any case, in our data, values outside this interval never occurred.', 'To determine if the SPAEF values were significantly different from zero, we built a shuffled distribution over 1000 permutations. We then used a two-sided test to extract p-values, considering significance at p0.05. To determine the noise ceiling, we performed 1000 within-agent half-splits. That is, for each iteration and each neuron, we randomly split the trials for each agent into two independent halves, computed the spatial tuning maps separately for each half, and then measured the spatial similarity between the two resulting maps. This process estimates the upper bound of explainable variance by accounting for the inherent noise in the data, providing a reference against which observed spatial similarities can be compared.']\"}, {'heading': 'K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis', 'content': \"['For this analysis, we included the entire neuronal population (390 neurons). We computed spatial tuning curves for each neuron based on the positions of the self and chosen prey. The task space (computer monitor) was divided into a 66 grid, resulting in a 36-bin tuning curve for each neuron per agent. Each tuning curve was then normalized between 0 and 1 on a per-neuron basis, by dividing by the maximum value of the respective neurons tuning curve. This ensured that differences in firing rates did not bias our subsequent analyses. We then applied the k-means clustering algorithm to the normalized tuning curves. Clustering was performed separately for self-position tuning curves and chosen prey-position tuning curves. To determine the optimal number of clusters we used silhouette values, which assess clustering quality by measuring how well each data point fits within its assigned cluster relative to other clusters. A silhouette score closer to -1 indicates potential misclassification, while a score closer to 1 suggests strong cluster cohesion and clear separation from other clusters (Rousseeuw, 1986). We selected the number of clusters that maximized the silhouette value, which turned out to be two for both self and chosen prey position tuning curves. Thus we could classify each neuron as belonging to cluster 1 or cluster 2.', 'We then performed principal component analysis (PCA) to visualize how the structure of the spatial tuning curves varies across neurons.

We validated the clustering output using silhouette scores, which can provide an estimate of the most likely number of true clusters (Rousseeuw, 1987). This analysis shows that only two clusters are needed (mean silhouette value  0.6, Figure 3A,B). In our population of neurons, 70.5 (n275390) belong to cluster 1 (C1) which has neurons with broad spatial tuning; the remaining 29.5 (n115390) are in cluster 2 (C2), which has neurons with narrow place cell-like tuning (Figure 3A,B).', 'We applied principal component analysis (PCA) on the self-position tuning functions and visualized the population distribution in a lower dimensional space (Methods). Neurons belonging to cluster 1 and cluster 2 are clearly separable along the first principal component (PC1), which represents the overall spatial extent of the tuning, while the second principal component (PC2) may capture differences in neurons preferred firing locations, signifying spatial preference (Figure 3C). Indeed, neurons with broad spatial representations are distributed on the right side of PC1, with little variability along both PC1 and PC2, which may indicate greater spatial extent and lower spatial preference. That is, firing patterns are more widespread and heterogeneous across multiple spatial locations (Figure 3C). In contrast, neurons with narrow spatial representations were more dispersed along both PC1 and PC2, reflecting greater variability in their tuning peaks -spatial extent -and spatial preference (Figure 3C).', 'We performed the same clustering procedure, but this time using chosen preys position tuning functions (Methods). As with self-position, the silhouette test showed optimal results with k  2 (mean silhouette value  0.5, Figure 3B), confirming that population response relies on broad and narrow maps to represent position (Figure 3D). For these chosen prey maps, we found that 57.44 (n224390) belong to cluster 1, while the remaining 42.56 (n166390) belong to cluster 2. The overwhelming majority of neurons (79.80) consistently fall into the same cluster for self-and prey-position (Figure 3E,F,G,I), whereas the remaining 20.20 of neurons switch between broad and narrow spatial maps (Figure 3E,F,H,J). Repeating the same analysis on both self and chosen prey maps, first applying PCA followed by k-means clustering, yielded similar results.', 'We found that broad and narrow neuron maps are differentially distributed along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. Specifically, we observed a greater preponderance of broadly tuned neurons in the anterior hippocampus and a greater preponderance of neurons with narrow spatial tuning in the posterior hippocampus (Figure 3K). Among cluster 1 neurons, 53.80 localized rostrally with the remaining 46.20 caudally, with no significance difference between them (one sample z-test for proportions: p  0.99). Among cluster 2 neurons, 44.30 are found rostrally and 55.70 caudally. While this difference is modest, it is statistically significant (one sample z-test for proportions: p  0.007; Figure 3K). This result remained unchanged even when considering only the significantly tuned neurons. Out of the cluster 2 tuned neurons, 42.10 localize in the anterior hippocampus and 57.90 in the posterior (one sample z-test for proportions: p  0.003; data not shown). Moreover, within the posterior hippocampus, we found a higher proportion of cluster 2 neurons compared to cluster 1 (one sample z-test for proportions: p  0.021; Figure 3K). Within the anterior hippocampus, instead, there was no significant difference between the proportion of cluster 1 and cluster 2 neurons (one sample z-test for proportions: p  0.98, Figure 3K). Together, these results confirm theories that anterior and posterior hippocampus have measurable functional differences.', 'Last, we examined how these two distinct categories of neurons fire across space along with the associated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), defined as the tuning curve variance normalized by firing rate (Methods). We found that neurons carrying broad spatial representation exhibit higher firing rates but carry less spatial information compared to narrowly tuned neurons (ranksum, p  0.001; Figure 3L,M). Nonetheless, the SNR remained comparable across clusters (Figure 3N), indicating that the firing rate and information per spike roughly cancelled each other out. However, we did find that neurons in the posterior hippocampus had lower firing rates but higher SNR compared to anterior hippocampal neurons (Figure 3L,N).

Moreover, blending orthogonal and collinear subspaces, producing semi-orthogonal subspaces, allows for discrimination while enabling cross-categorical generalization (Figure 4A-D; Barak et al., 2013;Bernardi et al., 2020;Johnston et al., 2024).', 'To test the hypothesis that hippocampal neural populations use semi-orthogonal subspaces to disentangle agents maps, we adapted a method previously developed to study motor regions (Elsayed et al., 2016). This analysis quantifies the degree of overlap between spatial representations for self and prey, by projecting the population activity onto lowdimensional subspaces that capture most of the variance between agents representations (Methods). We applied this analysis separately to both clusters. We found that neurons with broad spatial maps (cluster 1) use distinct, semi-orthogonal subspaces to individuate agents locations. We also found that neurons with narrow spatial maps (cluster 2) represent self and prey on nearly collinear subspaces.', 'In more detail, we started by analyzing the correlation structure for self and prey representations. For each agent, we computed the spatial similarity between the tuning surfaces for each pair of neurons (Figure 4E,F). Each entry in the resulting spatial similarity matrix represents the degree of spatial similarity between the response patterns of two neurons. For C1 neurons, the matrix structure changes markedly across agents (Figure 4E), whereas for C2 neurons, it remains largely consistent (Figure 4F). Indeed, when we compared the entries of the self matrix against the entries of the prey matrix, we found little or no correlation (C1: not different from chance, determined by pseudocorrelation, self vs chosen prey: R2  0.19  0.040, p  0.46; self vs unchosen prey: R2  0.06  0.039, p  0.99; two-sided permutation test, α  0.05; Figure 4G; C2: self vs chosen prey: R²  0.19  0.037, p  0.001; self vs unchosen prey: R²  0.14  0.038, p  0.006, Figure 4H). Thus, for a pair of neurons with broad spatial maps (cluster 1), the similarity of their responses to self-locations does not inform the similarity of their responses to prey locations. A possibility is that these neurons individuate agents in space with some dimensions dedicated to self-only, some to prey-only, and some to both -aligning with the hypothesis of semi-orthogonality between neural subspaces.', 'To understand if these subspaces were semi-orthogonal, we applied eigendecomposition to the self spatial similarity matrix and individuated the top self-principal components (PCs). If self and prey maps are semi-orthogonal, the self-PCs should capture very little prey variance (Methods). To assess if self-PCs can significantly capture the prey maps variance, we computed variance explain noise ceiling and confidence intervals through half-split cross-validation (CV) (Methods). For each split, we used half of the self spatial maps (train half) to compute the self-PCs. We then use these self-PCs to project the test halfs spatial maps for both self (within-self variance) and prey (cross-agents variance). The distribution of within-self variances gives an estimate of noise ceiling, while the cross-agents variance explained quantifies how well self-PCs capture prey maps variance. The variability of both within-self and across-agents variance provides confidence intervals for each agents projections.', 'For cluster 1 neurons, we found that the prey variance explained was significantly lower than noise ceiling (p  0.001, for PC1 to PC10), though confidence intervals did not overlap between self and prey projections for PC1 only. That is, self-PC1 carries information unique to the self maps. Overlapping confidence intervals for the remaining components implied that self and prey representations share non-zero variance (Figure 4I).', 'Lastly, to estimate the degree of orthogonality between agents neural subspaces, we identified the top prey-PCs, and estimated the cosine similarity between self and prey -PCs. A value of cosine similarity close to zero means orthogonality, while values closer to 1 or -1 collinearity. The cosine similarity values between the self-PCs and prey-PCs, fluctuate around zero, confirming weak alignment between PCs, i.e., semi-orthogonality between subspaces (Figure 4K). In summary, these results tell us that neurons with broad spatial tuning individuate prey and self using semi-orthogonal neural subspaces.', 'The same decomposition analysis performed on neurons with sparse spatial tuning (cluster 2), yielded slightly different results. Given the significant correlations between self and prey representations, a potential explanation is that agents lie on collinear subspaces. We found that also in this case, the prey variance explained is significantly lower than noise ceiling (p  0.001, for PC1 to PC10), but confidence intervals overlap across all the PCs, indicating shared variance between self and prey maps (Figure 4J). The cosine similarity between the top two self-PCs and chosen prey-PCs significantly differs from zero (PCs1: 0.78, p  0.02; PCs2: -0.36, p  0.04, Figure 4L). Our results indicate that neurons with narrow spatial maps represent self and prey in nearly collinear subspaces, and that subspace semi-orthogonalization in hippocampal neurons is primarily driven by neural populations with broad spatial tuning. uncorrelated activity results in subspace orthogonalization (bottom row) and vice versa (upper row).

Rather than use a labelled line code (in which a given neurons responses correspond to the position of a single agent), maps are multiplexed. This multiplexing of information raises an individuation problem: if firing rate of a neuron changes, which of the tracked agents does that change refer to? Our data suggest that the hippocampus solves this problem by recourse to semiorthogonal subspaces, which blend orthogonal and collinear subspaces. Subspace partition allows for simultaneous separation of information (thus solving the individuation problem) while also allowing for cross-agent generalization, greatly facilitating flexible learning (Barak et al., 2013;Fusi et al., 2016;Johnston et al., 2024). These results, then, build on recent findings showing that rat and bat hippocampus contains cells whose firing rates encode the positions of conspecifics in the environment. Specifically, we find that cells with similar functional properties can be found in the human hippocampus, and moreover, that they can flexibly partition information to achieve individuation.', 'We find evidence for two categories of cells, based on the shape of their tuning surface for location (broad and narrow). The cells in the smaller cluster 2 have narrow highly localized regions of strong activity, which give them a clear featural resemblance to place cells. However, the cells in the larger cluster 1 have a distinct lack of localized tuning, but nonetheless still carry information about spatial position. These cells have some resemblance to non-grid cells in the rat entorhinal cortex, which were discovered using the same mapping algorithm we employ here (Hardcastle et al., 2017 see also Diehl et al., 2017). Moreover, the category a cell falls in for selfmaps is generally the same category as it falls in for other maps, suggesting map shape may be an intrinsic property of neurons, rather than an arbitrary feature. Surprisingly, the subspace semiorthogonalization appears mostly to be a property of the cluster 1 neurons, suggesting that an overly strict focus on place-cells with focal tuning may result in ignoring important functional features of hippocampal maps.', 'Our results show a modest but highly significant difference in the distribution of functional cell types in the anterior (fewer cluster 2) and posterior (more cluster 2) hippocampus.', 'These results relate to ongoing discussions about the potential functional differences between these regions (which are homologous to the rodent ventral and dorsal hippocampi, respectively, Strange et al., 2014;To et al., 2024). The increased number of place-cell like coding in posterior hippocampus, then, recapitulates known findings from rats (e.g., Jung et al., 1994;Kjelstrup et al., 2018). Finally, the localization of partitioning to the more anterior cluster 1 neurons aligns this part of the hippocampus with the kind of flexible adaptive cognition associated with prefrontal cortex, with which anterior hippocampus has strong connections (Dalton et al., 2022).', 'Nonetheless, the differences we observe are modest, and, overall, our results endorse functional continuity of the human hippocampus.', 'Our results relate to a previous series of three papers from our laboratory, in which macaques performed a similar task (Yoo et al., 2020 and2021B;Fine et al., 2024). In those papers, we found that dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) actively predicts the future position of pursued prey about 700 ms into the future (Yoo et al., 2020), also tracks a suite of allocentric and egocentric variables related to the task (Yoo et al., 2021B), and corresponds with inferred decision variables in the task (Fine et al., 2024). Relative to macaques, human behavior is quite different -most critically, our macaque subjects needed at least three months to learn the task, whereas humans need no training. Moreover, humans show evidence of highly efficient behavioral strategies, such as cornering the prey, that macaques do not seem to learn, even with months of training. In any case, our results here, focusing on the individuation problem, which was not addressed in our earlier work, complement and extend our earlier findings.', 'We find it interesting that hippocampus actively tracks the position of the unpursued prey. In our task, subjects typically select a single prey and pursue it for several seconds until capture, leaving the other, unchosen one, ostensibly irrelevant. Nonetheless, from the perspective of the hippocampus, this unselected prey shows only modest evidence of deprioritization.', '(Namely, hippocampus still tracks the unpursued prey, although less robustly as it tracks the pursued prey). The goal of the task is not, however, simply to track the preferred prey; instead the player is allowed to switch to following the alternative (and sometimes does so, when, for example, the unpursued prey comes nearby). Thus, from the perspective of choice, although not behavior, monitoring the position of the unpursued prey is crucial: because switching is always a possibility, continuing to focus on the pursued prey represents a decision to not switch. Our results are reminiscent of theories in which the hippocampus maps potential alternatives to current goals, rather than being limited to representing only the goals themselves.']\"}, {'heading': 'Human intracranial neurophysiology', 'content': \"['Experimental data were recorded from 13 adult patients (6 males and 7 females) undergoing intracranial monitoring for epilepsy.
