extraction_task:
  description: >
    From the given literature extract named entities from neuroscience statements. 
    A named entity is anything that can be referred to with a proper name. 
    Some common named entities in neuroscience articles are animal species (e.g., mouse, drosophila, zebrafish), anatomical regions (e.g., neocortex, mushroom body, cerebellum), experimental conditions (e.g., control, tetrodotoxin treatment, Scn1a knockout), and cell types (e.g., pyramidal neuron, direction-sensitive mechanoreceptor, oligodendrocyte)

alignment_task:
  description: >
    Take the output of extractor_agent {extracted_structured_information} as input and perform the concept alignment using the ontological concepts. 
    A concept alignment is anything where you align the given entity to the matching concept aka class from a ontology or a schema.
    Add the remark stating if the alignment was made based on the searched knowledge source result or not, i.e., if the ontology id or label aka ontology information is present in the search result in local knowledge source.

    Take the output of alignment agent {aligned_structured_information} as input and perform the following evaluation: 
    1. Assess the quality and accuracy of the alignment with the ontology or schema in {aligned_structured_information}.

    3. Update the {aligned_structured_information} adding the judge_score.
    4. Update the remark with reason why such score or anyother information from evaluation. Please make sure you do not remove previous remark, just add more as required.
